# Design Document

## 0 Title & Team: XL Reservation Stats: Qingyuan Fan, Pan Lu, Somer Lillard, Yutong Wu.

## 1 Overview: As an ambassador I will be able to see the xl lab's reservation statistics in order to better understand the lab's demand usage. An ambassador will also be able to have access to visualizations of the statistics data and access to reports of common queries for convenience. As a student I will be able to see my personal statistics in order to efficiently utilize my time in the lab.

## 2 Key Personas: Describe the key personas your feature serves. What are their needs and goals with your feature?

## 3 User Stories organized by persona, necessity for a minimum-viable feature, and frequency/importance of use.

## 4 Wireframes / Mockups: Include rough wireframes of your feature’s user interfaces for the most critical user stories, along with brief descriptions of what is going on. These can be hand-drawn, made in PowerPoint/KeyNote, or created with a tool like Figma. To see an example of a detailed wireframe Kris made this summer before building the drop-in feature, see this Figma board. You will notice the final implementation is not 1:1 with the original wireframe!

## 5 Technical Implementation Opportunities and Planning

    ## What specific areas of the existing code base will you directly depend upon, extend, or integrate with?

## 1. What planned page components and widgets, per the assigned reading, do you anticipate needing in your feature’s frontend?

## 2. What additional models, or changes to existing models, do you foresee needing (if any)?

## 3. Considering your most-frequently used and critical user stories, what API / Routes do you foresee modifying or needing to add?

## 4. What concerns exist for security and privacy of data? Should the capabilities you are implementing be specific to only certaain users or roles? (For example: When Sally Student makes a reservation, only Sally Student or Amy Ambassador should be able to cancel the reservation. Another student, such as Sam Student, should not be able to cancel Sally’s reservation.)
